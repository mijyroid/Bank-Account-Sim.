ABOUT PROJECT:
~This project simulates a bank account system using C++ 
and demonstrates the application of object-oriented programming concepts, including classes and objects, to model account behavior. 

~Key functionalities include performing account operations such as deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries, with data stored using arrays. 
~The simulation showcases fundamental programming principles such as encapsulation, data abstraction, 
and basic array manipulation to create a functional and interactive banking model.
